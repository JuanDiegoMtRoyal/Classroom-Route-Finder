# Classroom-Route-Finder
 An imperative and declarative solution for finding a path between classrooms at MRU given certain constraints. Implemented in Java and Haskell 

 #JAVA
 * The first step is to make sure you have a JDK installed. If you are using visual studio code download the Microsoft java extension pack. Once you have the Classroom Route Finder folder open, enter the src folder and type ```javac *.java``` to compile everything. Then run the program by entering ```java Main startclassroom endclassroom timeconstraint(int 1-6) mobilityconstraint(bool true/false)``` at the prompt, with the classroom parameters replaced by any classroom in the building text file that is located in the data folder.
